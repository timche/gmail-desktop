# @meru/dark-theme

Applies a dark theme to any DOM element and its subtree — colors, gradients, and images — with good contrast, and without touching the rest of the document.

## Usage

```ts
import { applyDarkTheme } from "@meru/dark-theme";

const controller = applyDarkTheme(element);

// When the subtree is discarded, for example by removing it from the DOM:
controller.destroy();

// Or, to undo theming on a still-live subtree:
controller.revert();
```

The engine needs a DOM context, because it uses `getComputedStyle`, `<canvas>`, and `Image`. Use it in a renderer or a content script rather than in the Electron main process.

## Options

The `options` argument of `applyDarkTheme(root, options?)` is a partial `Theme` plus the following engine options:

- `backgroundColor` / `textColor`: the HSL poles that light colors are remapped toward. Default `#181a1b` / `#e8e6e3`.
- `brightness` / `contrast` / `sepia` / `grayscale`: filter adjustments applied on top of the remap. Default `100` / `100` / `0` / `0`.
- `ignore?: Array<string | { selector: string; properties: string[] }>`: opts elements out of theming. A **string** selector keeps its matching elements and their descendants fully original, matched with `closest` — colored chips or badges, for example. An **object** skips only the listed `properties` on elements matching its `selector`, matched with `matches`, and leaves those properties to CSS. `{ selector: ".foo", properties: ["border-color"] }` lets a stylesheet set the border color, which the engine's inline override would otherwise win over, and `"border-color"` covers all four sides. The skip applies across every path the engine darkens a property from — the inline override, the `::before` and `::after` pseudo rules, and the darkened `:hover` and `:focus` state rules — so an ignored property stays with CSS in every state.
- `observe?: boolean`: watches the subtree and keeps theming content added later, and re-themes an element when its class changes, so that state-driven styles are darkened too — a shadow that a sticky toolbar gains on scroll, for example. Defaults to `true`. Call `revert()` or `destroy()` to disconnect.
- `css?: string`: CSS injected into the document while the theme is active and removed on `revert()` or `destroy()`. Use it for rules the inline-override engine can't reach, such as `:hover` and `:focus` backgrounds or `::before` icons, scoped with the `[data-dark-theme]` attribute so that they apply only where the engine has themed.
- `invertImageUrls?: string[]`: URL prefixes of dark monochrome icons to blank-invert with `filter: invert(1)`, covering an element's `background-image` and a pseudo-element's `content` or `background-image`. It's a pragmatic stand-in for pixel analysis when the icon is cross-origin, and therefore CORS-tainted and impossible to inspect — a site's material-icon CDN path, for example. Matched with `startsWith`.
- `invertImageExcludeFilenames?: string[]`: filenames, meaning the last path segment of the URL, that `invertImageUrls` skips even when their prefix matches. Use it for a colored icon variant that shares a path with the monochrome ones, which inverting would recolor wrongly.

## Controller

- `revert()`: disconnects the observer, restores every element's original inline styles, and releases references. Use it on a **still-live** subtree.
- `destroy()`: disconnects the observer and releases references **without** restoring styles. Use it when the subtree is being discarded, because restoring would be wasted work.

## Behavior notes

- Light-valued CSS custom properties declared or referenced in the document's **same-origin** stylesheets are darkened and re-declared scoped to `[data-dark-theme]`, so surfaces painted through `var(--token)` are covered even in states the element walk never observes. A variable inherits, so the dark value cascades into the themed subtree and stops at its boundary. Properties declared only in cross-origin stylesheets are missed, the same CORS limit that applies to images. A `css` override for the same property still wins, so hand-tune exceptions there.
- The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are darkened too. Their non-inheriting paint — background, border, box-shadow, and gradient background-images — is remapped and emitted into an injected stylesheet keyed to the owning element. Their `color` isn't touched, because it inherits the element's own themed color. A pseudo content image can't be color-inspected when it's cross-origin, the same CORS limit that applies to `<img>`. If its URL matches `invertImageUrls` it's blank-inverted, and otherwise left alone. The invert decision is re-evaluated when the element's class or state changes, so an icon whose URL swaps on toggle, such as a star, gains or loses the invert to match.
- The `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active` styles are read from the document's **same-origin** author rules, darkened, and re-emitted with each selector kept verbatim inside a CSS `@scope (root)` block, so that they apply only within the themed subtree. A computed-style snapshot can't see them, because the state isn't active at theme time. Rules declared only in cross-origin stylesheets are missed, the same CORS limit.
- Colors apply synchronously. Image analysis is asynchronous and resolves shortly after.
- Calling `applyDarkTheme` again themes only the elements not yet themed, so it's safe to call as the subtree grows.
- Overrides are inline `!important`. Use `ignore` for elements that must keep their own colors, because a stylesheet rule can't override an inline `!important`.
- Cross-origin images need CORS to be analyzed, and are otherwise left untouched.

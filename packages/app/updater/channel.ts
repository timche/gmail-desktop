/**
 * The name electron-updater resolves a stable feed under — `latest-mac.yml`,
 * `latest-linux.yml`, `latest.yml` — and what its providers fall back to when
 * no channel is set.
 *
 * Naming it is what makes leaving Beta work. `autoUpdater.channel` refuses
 * anything but a non-empty string once a channel has been assigned, so a
 * session that visited Beta cannot be handed `null` to get back to stable: the
 * setter throws `ERR_UPDATER_INVALID_CHANNEL` out of the configuration
 * listener, and the properties after it never get applied.
 *
 * It also makes the stable feed independent of the build asking for it. Unset,
 * the GitHub provider falls through to the channel baked into the build's
 * `app-update.yml`, which on a Beta build is `beta` — so a user stepping back
 * to stable would ask a stable release for `beta-mac.yml` and get a 404 with no
 * fallback.

 * leave the channel, rather than leaving them there until a stable overtakes
 * the version they are on.

/*
 * The compose window Help → Report Issue… opens.
 *
 * Every Gmail preload feature reads its switch from `process.argv`, which is
 * the renderer process's own command line: Electron appends a view's
 * `additionalArguments` to it when it starts the process. Gmail's own compose
 * pop-out is opened by the page through `window.open`, so Chromium hosts it in
 * the Gmail view's process and the pop-out finds the Gmail view's arguments
 * there without anyone passing them. `Gmail.createComposeWindow` builds a
 * `WorkspaceApp` of its own instead, which starts a process of its own, and
 * that process carries only what its view was created with.
 *
 * Asserted on the command line the OS reports for each view's process, because
 * that is exactly what the preload sees and nothing closer is reachable: a
 * sandboxed preload's `process.argv` is out of a test's reach, and
 * `getLastWebPreferences` does not report `additionalArguments`.
 *
 * Under a license, because the flag the report is about is Pro-gated: `Gmail`
 * only pushes it when `licenseKey.isValid`, so a free launch would have nothing
 * to look for in either process.
